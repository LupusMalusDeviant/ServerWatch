# Mcp

The **MCP (Model Context Protocol) server**: how external AI agents (e.g. Claude Code) operate Whiskers. This folder holds the request-authentication pipeline and the permission-check helper; the tools themselves live in [`Tools/`](Tools/).

Every MCP request carries a `Bearer <API-KEY>` header. The middleware authenticates it before ASP.NET's default OAuth challenge runs, and each tool calls `McpPermissionCheck` to enforce its Read/Write/Admin level for that key.

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `McpBearerAuthMiddleware.cs` | Authenticates MCP requests by Bearer token before the Google OAuth challenge kicks in (so API clients aren't redirected to a login page). |
| `McpCallLogMiddleware.cs` | Records every external/direct `tools/call` (callers that bypass the in-process agent) into the Agent-History log via [`IMcpCallLogStore`](../Services/Observability/). Sniffs the JSON-RPC envelope only, never alters the request, never throws. The in-process agent path is logged separately in [`AgentToolInvoker`](../Services/Agent/AgentToolInvoker.cs). |
| `McpApiKeyAuth.cs` | `McpApiKeyStore`, the API-key store backing authentication. On first run it generates an admin key and writes it to a `0600` `initial-mcp-key.txt` next to `api-keys.json` — **never to the log** (only the file path is logged). The setup wizard will later surface it once and delete the file. |
| `IMcpApiKeyStore.cs` | Legacy flat API-key store interface (kept for backwards compatibility). |
| `McpPermissionCheck.cs` | Helper called from inside tool methods: extracts the API key (or the web user's role) from the HTTP context and checks the required permission level. Returns a denial message or `null` if allowed. |
| `McpToolLevelAttribute.cs` | `[McpToolLevel(...)]` — declares a tool's minimum permission level **on the method**, next to `[McpServerTool]`. A declaration only: the request path still reads `McpPermissionLevels.DefaultToolLevels`. It exists because an unlisted tool falls back to `admin`, so a forgotten dictionary entry yields a tool that is registered and listed but denied to the agent on every call, with nothing logged. |
| `McpToolLevelCatalog.cs` | Reads those declarations by reflection and shapes them like `DefaultToolLevels` so the two can be compared, plus the method-name → wire-name (snake_case) derivation. Never on the request path — a bug here fails a test, not a request. Feeds the tool-catalog snapshot (Plan-0013 WP3). |

| `McpToolCatalogRenderer.cs` | Renders the tool catalog (name, level, module, description) as the Markdown checked in at [`../../../docs/mcp-tool-catalog.md`](../../../docs/mcp-tool-catalog.md). Deterministic output, so a change to the served surface always shows up as a reviewable diff. |

Enforced by three test classes, each answering a different question:

| Test | Question |
|---|---|
| `McpToolLevelTests` | Does every tool declare a level, does it match the dictionary, and does the method's own name reach the permission gate? |
| `McpToolRegistrationTests` | Does each **module** still contribute the tools it is pinned to? |
| `McpToolCatalogSnapshotTests` | Did the surface change without the catalog being updated? |
| `McpServedSurfaceTests` | Does the **running server** answer `tools/list` with exactly those tools? |

The last one is the only one that would have caught the 0.12.0–0.13.0 regression, where the shipped server served zero tools while every code-inspecting check stayed green. Verified by reintroducing that bug: only `McpServedSurfaceTests` went red.

## Two numbers worth looking at now and then

Tests prove the surface is *consistent*. They cannot tell you it is *usable* — that only shows in how the tools
are actually called. Both numbers come from `McpToolCalls` (see [`../Services/Observability/`](../Services/Observability/)):

```sql
-- 1. Tools that are always refused. A rate near 100% is not strictness, it is a wrong level:
--    the tool exists, callers reach for it, and never get through.
SELECT ToolName,
       SUM(CASE WHEN Verdict <> 'allow' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*) AS DeniedPct,
       COUNT(*) AS Calls
FROM McpToolCalls
WHERE Timestamp > datetime('now', '-90 days')
GROUP BY ToolName
HAVING Calls > 5
ORDER BY DeniedPct DESC;

-- 2. Tools nobody ever calls. A few are fine; many mean the catalog is bloated or the
--    descriptions do not say what the tool is for — the agent picks by description.
SELECT ToolName FROM McpToolCalls
WHERE Timestamp > datetime('now', '-90 days')
GROUP BY ToolName;   -- compare against docs/mcp-tool-catalog.md
```

There is no dedicated view for this yet; it is a periodic manual check.
