# Services/Notifications

Outbound alerting. Health/log/update events are dispatched through a **composite** that fans out to every configured channel (Mattermost, Matrix, Telegram, ntfy, Discord, Email, generic webhook), with throttling and per-container preferences so you only get the alerts you asked for.

Each channel has its own interface (distinct strategies) so the composite can enable/disable them independently. Channels are configured in the UI (Settings → Benachrichtigungen / Weitere Benachrichtigungskanäle), persisted live to `app-settings.json`.

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `INotificationService.cs` | The notification surface consumers call (channel-agnostic). |
| `INotificationChannel.cs` | The unifying channel contract (changeme C9): every channel implements it, so the composite fans out over `IEnumerable<INotificationChannel>` instead of hard-wiring each one. `Name` defaults to the type name minus `NotificationService`. |
| `NoopNotificationService.cs` | Core default `INotificationService` that does nothing. Registered before the module loop so every consumer still resolves when the **Notifications module** is off; the module's composite wins by last-registration when on (RoadToSAP Phase 1). |
| `CompositeNotificationService.cs` | Delegates each notification to all configured channels + the in-app feed + the AI-trigger dispatcher. Also the single enforcement point for the per-container mute/prefs and the writer of the persisted `AlertHistory`. |
| `NotificationFormatter.cs` | Single source of truth: event → title / severity / detail / in-app link, shared by the store and the outbound channels. |
| `IMattermostNotificationService.cs` / `MattermostNotificationService.cs` | Mattermost channel (webhook). |
| `IMatrixNotificationService.cs` / `MatrixNotificationService.cs` | Matrix channel. |
| `ITelegramNotificationService.cs` / `TelegramNotificationService.cs` | Telegram bot channel (sendMessage API). |
| `INtfyNotificationService.cs` / `NtfyNotificationService.cs` | ntfy push channel (ntfy.sh or self-hosted; severity → priority/tags). |
| `IDiscordNotificationService.cs` / `DiscordNotificationService.cs` | Discord incoming-webhook channel (coloured embeds per severity). |
| `ISlackNotificationService.cs` / `SlackNotificationService.cs` | Slack incoming-webhook channel (coloured attachments per severity). |
| `IEmailNotificationService.cs` / `EmailNotificationService.cs` | Email (SMTP) channel via `System.Net.Mail`. |
| `IWebhookNotificationService.cs` / `WebhookNotificationService.cs` | Generic outbound webhook (POSTs a JSON event). Distinct from the inbound [`../Webhooks/`](../Webhooks/). |
| `IContainerNotificationPrefsService.cs` / `ContainerNotificationPrefsService.cs` | Per-container notification preferences (which events should notify). |
| `NotificationThrottler.cs` | Suppresses duplicate/flapping notifications within a time window (read live from settings per call, so a changed window takes effect immediately; the map self-prunes so it can't grow unbounded). |
| `NotificationRetry.cs` | Retries a send once on failure and never propagates (safe inside a monitoring loop). With the per-client 15s HttpClient timeout, this bounds how long a slow endpoint can delay a background cycle. |
| `InAppNotificationStore.cs` | `IInAppNotificationStore`, the bell feed + persistent history (no external channel needed); fed by the composite. Keeps an in-memory cache for the bell's live updates AND write-through-persists every event to SQLite (`NotificationEntity`), hydrating on startup so the history survives restarts. Formats each event into an `InAppNotification` (title, severity) with a relative, path-base-safe `Link`, and serves the filtered/paged query for the `/notifications` page ([`../../Components/Pages/NotificationsLog.razor`](../../Components/Pages/NotificationsLog.razor)). |

## Cross-cutting rules enforced by the composite

- **Mute/prefs are checked once, centrally.** They used to be consulted only by the container health
  monitor, so muting a container still let its log alerts, CVE findings, image updates and metric alarms
  through. Every producer now passes the same gate. Events without a container name (server-level events
  such as `server_unreachable`) are never suppressed by it.
- **Every delivered event is persisted to `AlertHistory`** (server id, container, type, message) — the
  queryable, fleet-aware record behind the in-app feed. Retention is handled by the metrics collector's
  hourly prune. A failing history write never blocks the notification itself.
- **HTML encoding.** Matrix renders `formatted_body` as HTML, so its message is built from an escaped copy
  of the event (`MatrixNotificationService.HtmlEscaped`) — the log-alert detail carries raw log lines, which
  are third-party text. The plain-text body stays verbatim.

## Server-level events

`server_unreachable` / `server_recovered` come from the [health monitor](../HealthMonitor/) when a host
stops answering the fleet-wide container listing. They carry `ServerId`/`ServerName` instead of a
container, link to `/servers`, and are available as AI-trigger event types.

## Secret hygiene

The capability-bearing channels put their secret in the request URL (Telegram bot token in the path; Discord/Slack/Mattermost/ntfy/webhook secret URLs). Those `System.Net.Http.HttpClient.*` logger categories are raised to Warning in `Program.cs`, so the default HttpClient request logging can't write the token/URL to the app log.

## Wiring

These channel implementations live in Core, but their DI registration (the 8 channel settings, the
`INotificationChannel`s and `CompositeNotificationService`) is the opt-in **Notifications module**
([`../../Modules/Notifications/`](../../Modules/Notifications/), toggle `Features:notifications:Enabled`). The
in-app feed store, per-container prefs and the HttpClient log-filter stay in Core so the bell + `/notifications`
page keep working when the module is off.
