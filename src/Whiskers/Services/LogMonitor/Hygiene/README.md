# Log hygiene

Why the log-alert scan steps over certain containers, and how that decision is made without guessing.

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `ILogScanExclusions.cs` | The contract: which containers are skipped, with a machine-readable reason and a human-readable justification. |
| `LogScanExclusions.cs` | Access-path detection plus the `SERVERWATCH_SELF_CONTAINERS` override. |
| `ILogInventory.cs` / `LogInventory.cs` | The daily reading: rotation limit, log file size, growth per day, free disk. |
| `LogHygieneAdvice.cs` | Turns a reading into a severity, a description with a deadline, and a runnable command. |
| `LogHygieneMonitor.cs` | Runs the survey once a day and raises `log_rotation_missing` when a finding crosses the threshold. |

## The feedback loop this ends

Two containers triggered the 2026-08-26 incident: the tunnel and the socket proxy through which Whiskers
reaches Docker. Every request Whiskers makes is a line in their logs, so scanning them means scanning the
record of the scan. Left alone for two weeks they grew to 822 MB between them.

This removes the **trigger**. It does not remove the cause — that was a log fetch which was abandoned rather
than cancelled, fixed under Plan-0001. The distinction is repeated in the alert text and in the MCP report on
purpose, because symptom relief that looks like a cure is how the real fix gets postponed.

## Detected by path, never by name

A container is on the access path because Whiskers **connects to it**: the port it publishes is the port in
this server's configuration, on an address that configuration names. A container that merely happens to be
called `socket-proxy` keeps being scanned — it is somebody else's proxy and its logs are somebody else's
evidence.

The bind address is part of the match. A container on `127.0.0.1:2376` cannot be the thing we reach at
`100.64.0.1:2376`, and treating the port number alone as proof would silently unmonitor a loopback service on
every host that reuses the port.

**Only the outermost hop is knowable.** Where Whiskers talks to a tunnel which talks to a socket proxy, the
tunnel is detected and the proxy behind it is not — nothing in a container list says who talks to whom. The
detection says so in its own justification text and names `SERVERWATCH_SELF_CONTAINERS` as the way to add the
second hop, so an operator is told rather than left to notice.

## The exclusion must not become the blind spot

Excluding a container by mistake is worse than missing a proxy: the container disappears from log monitoring
and looks exactly like one with nothing to report. So every exclusion is visible in three places — the server
view, the `whiskers_log_scan_exclusions` gauge on `/metrics`, and the `get_log_hygiene_report` MCP tool. What
to watch is not the gauge's value but its **movement**: exclusions appearing without a configuration change
mean the detection has grown too greedy.

Exclusion applies to the **log scan only**. These containers stay under health, metric and CVE monitoring —
their log content is worthless to us, their state is not.

## The inventory: unknown is a real answer

The survey runs **once a day**: one Docker inspect and one `stat` per container. A monitor that polled the
disk it is worried about would be the same incident one level down, and growth rates need consecutive
readings anyway.

Three rules keep it honest:

- **A size that cannot be read is reported as unknown, never as zero and never estimated.** A zero would read
  as "this log is empty" — the opposite of the truth on a host we cannot see into — and an estimate would be
  acted on as if it had been measured. The reason is carried with it, because an unexplained blank is
  indistinguishable from a container with nothing in its log.
- **The threshold is a share of the free disk, not a number of megabytes.** 150 MB is a note next to 10 GB of
  headroom and an alert next to 200 MB. Where `df` cannot be read there is no denominator, so a plain size
  floor takes over — staying quiet about a 2 GB log because one command failed would be the worse error.
- **One reading is a size; two are a trend.** Until the second reading the report says so instead of implying
  a rate it has not measured. The number that makes people act is not "150 MB", it is "this fills the disk on
  Thursday".

## It hands over the command; it does not run it

Setting a rotation limit recreates the container, and a restart is a decision with consequences. The alert
carries the compose snippet, the exact recreate command for that container, and the `daemon.json` default that
stops it happening to the *next* container — and it says out loud that the container will be recreated. An
operator who discovers the restart afterwards will not trust the next suggestion.

Every message repeats that this removes the **trigger** of the 2026-08-26 incident and not its cause. The
cause was a log fetch that was abandoned rather than cancelled. Symptom relief that reads like a cure is how
the real fix gets postponed, so the wording refuses to allow it — and a test holds that sentence in place.
