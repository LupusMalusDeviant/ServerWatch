/// <summary>
/// Turns the per-cycle "which servers answered" signal of a <see cref="FleetContainerListing"/> into
/// <c>server_unreachable</c> / <c>server_recovered</c> events.
/// <para>Until this existed, a host dropping off the fleet was silent: the dashboard showed it as
/// unreachable, but nothing was sent anywhere — and every container alert and log-alert rule covering
/// that host quietly stopped producing anything. A blind monitor looks exactly like a healthy one.</para>
/// <para>A single failed cycle is not an outage (a tunnel rebuild or a host slower than the listing's 8s
/// bound trips it), so an alert needs <paramref name="threshold"/> consecutive failures. Each outage is
/// announced once and closed by exactly one recovery.</para>
/// <para><b>Cold start.</b> An outage is a TRANSITION. Right after a restart the remote connections
/// (SSH tunnels, mTLS sessions) are not up yet, so every server fails the first cycles — measured on a
/// six-server fleet that produced ten pointless notifications per restart, which is exactly how an alert
/// gets ignored. A server that has not answered even once since start therefore needs the much longer
/// <paramref name="coldStartThreshold"/> before it counts as unreachable; once it has answered, the normal
/// threshold applies. A host that really is dead at startup is still reported, just later.</para>
