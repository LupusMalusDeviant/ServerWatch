/// <para><b>But a failed scan with nothing behind it has to be stored anyway.</b> The old code kept the
/// previous result in both cases, and when there was no previous result it therefore stored nothing at all —
/// leaving the target absent from every list. On 2026-08-28 two running containers on infomaniak had been in
/// that state: their local image layers were damaged, Trivy could not export them, and because neither had
/// ever been scanned successfully there they appeared nowhere. An absent target reads exactly like a clean
/// one, and the staleness metric cannot help — what is not there cannot age. Storing the failure makes the
/// target exist and say why it is empty.</para>
