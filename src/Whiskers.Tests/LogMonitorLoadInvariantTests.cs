/// The load invariants from the 2026-08-26 incident (Plan-0001 WP6.1/WP6.2).
///
/// <para>For six days Whiskers held a 2-core host at 98% CPU. The log monitor kept starting fresh log fetches
/// against two containers whose logs it could no longer read inside its 15-second window. It abandoned the
/// <em>wait</em> but not the <em>request</em>: <c>Task.WhenAny</c> leaves the losing task running, so the HTTP
/// call to dockerd stayed open until the proxy cut it after 600 seconds. At one new request per 60-second
/// cycle that settles at ten concurrent full-log scans per container — measured as 13 open file descriptors
/// and 1.15 million read() syscalls per second.</para>
///
/// <para>The incident report states the check that proves the fix, and these tests are that check:
/// <em>"the number of simultaneously open log requests against this container stays at no more than 1, and the
/// duration of a fetch does not grow over the cycles."</em> They are written to fail against the code that
/// caused the incident — a guard that was never seen red proves nothing.</para>
