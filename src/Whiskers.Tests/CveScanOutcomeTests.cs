/// <summary>
/// What happens to a scan that failed (2026-08-28).
///
/// <para>Two rules pull in opposite directions and both are right. A failed scan must never overwrite real
/// findings — replacing them with an empty result would report a clean bill of health and then re-notify
/// every CVE on the next success. But a failed scan with <em>nothing</em> behind it has to be stored anyway,
/// because the alternative is storing nothing at all, and a target that is absent reads exactly like a target
/// with no findings.</para>
///
/// <para>That second half was missing. Two running containers on infomaniak sat in exactly that state: their
/// local image layers were damaged, Trivy could not export them, neither had ever been scanned successfully
/// there, and so they appeared in no list at all. The staleness metric could not help — what is not there
/// cannot age. Only a person counting containers by hand would have noticed, and that is how it was found.</para>
