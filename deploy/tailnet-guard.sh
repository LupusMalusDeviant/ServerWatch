# tailnet-guard — keeps the Tailscale data path intact on this host.
#
# Why this exists: on 2026-08-20 a `docker compose up --build` (Whiskers deploy) produced a veth
# link-change storm, during which tailscale0 lost its IPv4/IPv6 addresses. tailscaled logged the loss
# ("LinkChange: major ... rebind-reason=[ips-changed]") but never restored them, so every 100.64/10
# route was gone: `tailscale ping` still worked (userspace disco) while ALL TCP traffic to the tailnet
# — Whiskers' mTLS Docker connections to five remote hosts — silently timed out via the default route.
#
# The check is deliberately end-to-end: an address on tailscale0 alone does not prove reachability.
#
#   --check-only   report and exit non-zero on breakage; never restart anything.
#
# Exit codes: 0 = healthy (or repaired), 1 = broken and repair failed / --check-only found breakage.
